# Education Accountability Platform

A national school-quality, complaint, and accountability platform: parents and students can search schools, submit **faceless (anonymized) complaints**, rate schools, and confirm whether issues were actually resolved — while schools and government officers work the case without ever seeing the submitter's real identity.

**Live (test):** https://edutest.agtci.com
**Stack:** Laravel 13, Livewire/Volt, Tailwind, MySQL (Hostinger) / SQLite (local dev)

This is **Phase 1** of a much larger spec — see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for exactly what's built vs. deliberately deferred, and don't take this repo as feature-complete against the original brief.

## What's actually here

- Auth + RBAC for 10 roles (spatie/laravel-permission)
- School registration, public search, school profile pages
- Faceless complaint system with real identity anonymization (see [`SECURITY_PRIVACY.md`](SECURITY_PRIVACY.md))
- Resolution-confirmation workflow ("was your issue *actually* resolved?")
- Basic School Quality Index with admin-configurable weights
- Parent, School Admin, and District Officer dashboards (other roles: login + placeholder only)
- Full audit logging + identity-access logging

## Quick start (local dev)
